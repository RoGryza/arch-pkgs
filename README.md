# Home Manager Config

My personal configs for [home-manager]. This repo is messy, if you're reading this as a reference
trying to get something done, feel free to [open a discussion] or e-mail me.

Some cool stuff (for some definition of cool):

* Multi-host setup with [`hosts.nix`](hosts.nix) and a script in [`shell.nix`](shell.nix)
_needs some work_.
* Nix-configured dwm.
* Neovim configuration options for [lsc] and [ale].
* Global theme management using [base16].
